The gourmet restaurant 'Unicafe' on the Kumpula campus of the University of Helsinki needs a new menu. 
The chef knows about programming and wants a computer system to manage the menu. 
In this assignment, we'll implement the heart of the system, the Menu class.
The menu object has an ArrayList as an instance variable to store the names of the dishes on the menu. The menu should provide the following methods:

public void addMeal(String meal) adds a meal to the menu. If the meal is already on the list, it should not be added again.
public void printMeals() prints the meals.
public void clearMenu() clears the menu.

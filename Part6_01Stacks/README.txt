A stack is a data structure that you can add to and take from. Always to the top of it or from the top.
Create a Stack class that has a list of strings as an instance variable. Add the following methods to the class:

public boolean isEmpty() - returns a boolean-type value (true or false) that tells whether or not the stack is empty.
public void add(String value) - Adds the value given as a parameter to the top of the stack.
public ArrayList<String> values() - returns the values contained in the stack as a list.

Add to the Stack class a public String take() method, which returns the topmost value (i.e., the last value added to the deque) and removes it from the stack.

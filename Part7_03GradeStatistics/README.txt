In this exercise we create a program for printing statistics for points in course. 
The program receives points (integers from zero to one hundred) as input, based on which it prints statistics about grades. 
Reading of input stops when the user enters the number -1. Numbers that are not within the interval [0-100] should not be taken into account when calculating the statistics.

oint average for points giving a passing grade
Extend the program, such that it in addition to giving the point average of all totals also provides the point average for points giving a passing grade.

A passing grade is achieved by getting a minimum of 50 course points. You may assume that the user always provides at least one integer between [0-100]. 
If there are no numbers giving a passing grade, the program should print a line "-" where the average would be.

Pass percentage
Extend the program from the previous part, such that it also print the pass percentage.
